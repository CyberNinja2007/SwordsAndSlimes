This project is on ASP.NET 5 MVC. Here I tried to implement a 3-level architecture, repository and unit of work patterns.
I used the following technologies:
1. Entity Framework Core to interact with the databases.
2. LINQ to select from the databases.
3. ASP.NET Identity to use the possibility of registration and authentithication.
4. Autofac to implement the inversion of control.
5. AutoMapper to easily convert some types.
